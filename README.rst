Review Board
============

`Review Board`_ is an open source, web-based code and document review tool
built to help companies,and also it is a powerful web-based code
review tool that offers developers an easy way to handle code reviews. 
open source projects, and other organizations keep their quality high and
their bug count low.

We began writing Review Board in 2006 to fill a hole in the code review market.
We wanted something open source that could be flexible enough to work with a
variety of workflows, and could take the pain out of the code review process.

Today, it's a vital part of the development process at thousands of projects
and companies, ranging from small startups of two people to enterprises of
thousands.

What does Review Board do?
--------------------------

Review Board tracks changes to your pending code, graphics, documents, and all
discussions around all the decisions made about your product. Our diff viewer
does more than just display diffs: It shows you exactly how your code was
changed, with syntax highlighting, interdiffs, moved line detection,
indentation change indicators, and more.

You can integrate with Review Board using its rich API and extension
frameworks, allowing custom features, review UIs, data analysis, and more to be
built without ever having to fork Review Board.

There's support for Bazaar, ClearCase, CVS, Git, Mercurial, Perforce, Plastic,
and Team Foundation Server, hosted on your own server or on Assembla,
Beanstalk, Bitbucket, Codebase, GitHub, GitLab, Gitorious, Kiln, or Unfuddle.
