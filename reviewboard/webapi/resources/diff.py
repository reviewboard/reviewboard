        This accepts a unified diff file, validates it, and stores it along
        with the draft of a review request. The new diff will have a revision
        of 0.

        A parent diff can be uploaded along with the main diff. A parent diff
        is a diff based on an existing commit in the repository, which will
        be applied before the main diff. The parent diff will not be included
        in the diff viewer. It's useful when developing a change based on a
        branch that is not yet committed. In this case, a parent diff of the
        parent branch would be provided along with the diff of the new commit,
        and only the new commit will be shown.

        It is expected that the client will send the data as part of a
        :mimetype:`multipart/form-data` mimetype. The main diff's name and
        content would be stored in the ``path`` field. If a parent diff is
        provided, its name and content would be stored in the
        ``parent_diff_path`` field.

        An example of this would be::

            -- SoMe BoUnDaRy
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name=path; filename="foo.diff"

            <Unified Diff Content Here>
            -- SoMe BoUnDaRy --

        Extra data can be stored on the diff for later lookup by passing
        ``extra_data.key_name=value``. The ``key_name`` and ``value`` can
        be any valid strings. Passing a blank ``value`` will remove the key.
        The ``extra_data.`` prefix is required.
