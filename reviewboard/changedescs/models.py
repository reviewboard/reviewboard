    This is a general model that can be used in applications for recording
    changes how they see fit. A helper function, 'record_field_changed',
    can be used to record information in a standard way for most value types,
    but the 'fields_changed' dictionary can be manipulated however the caller
    chooses.

    A ChangeDescription is not bound to a particular model. It is up to models
    to establish relationships with a ChangeDescription.

    Each field in 'fields_changed' represents a changed field.

    For string fields, the following fields will be available:

       * 'old': The old value of the field
       * 'new': The new value of the field

    For list and set fields, the following fields will be available:

       * 'removed': The fields that were removed, if any.
       * 'added': The fields that were added, if any.

        This will encode field changes following the rules in the

        ``name_field`` can be specified for lists or other iterables. When
        specified, each list item will be a tuple in the form of
        ``(object_name, object_url, object_id)``. Otherwise, it will be a
        tuple in the form of ``(item,)``.

        It is generally expected that fields with lists of model objects will
        have ``name_field`` set, whereas lists of numbers or some other
        value type will not. Specifying a ``name_field`` for non-objects will
        cause an :py:exc:`AttributeError`.
