/*
 * A resource for checking whether a diff will work.
 *
 * This is meant to be used as a sort of throwaway object, since a POST to the
 * diff validation resource does not actually create any state on the server.
 *
 * To use this, create an instance of the model, and set the diff and repository
 * attributes. The parentDiff and basedir attributes can also be set, in the
 * cases where the diff file requires a parent diff, and when the given
 * repository requires base directory information, respectively.
 *
 * Once these are set, calling save() will do a server-side check to make sure
 * that the supplied files parse correctly, and that the source revisions are
 * present in the given repository. save's 'success' and 'error' callbacks can
 * be used to act upon this information.
