/**
 * A component for rendering the thumbnail context for a comment.
 *
 * This is used for both draft comments (in the Review Dialog) and in
 * published comments (on a review).
 *
 * It manages a consistent header style, along with a content area that
 * contains the rendered thumbnail content. The thumbnail content may be
 * an image, lines of text, or an entire diff.
 *
 * There is a special case when it comes to diffs. For a diff, the header
 * is fully rendered as part of the diff display (as it may contain multiple
 * columns). In this case, this component will style the header within the
 * diff, and should not be given a separate header.
 *
 * Version Added:
 *     7.0
 *
 * DOM Attributes:
 *     aria-label (string):
 *         A label describing this thumbnail.
 *
 *         It should contain an identifier beyond just the filename/revision.
 *         For example, "File attachment thumbnail for my-filename.png".
 *
 * Modifiers:
 *     -expands-on-hover:
 *         Whether a contained diff will expand additional controls on hover.
 *
 *         This requires the ``-has-diff`` modifier.
 *
 *     -has-diff:
 *         Whether this thumbnail contains a diff.
 *
 * Structure:
 *     <div class="rb-c-review-comment-thumbnail
 *                 [-has-diff
 "                  [-expands-on-hover]]">
 *          aria-labelledby="<<string>>">
 *      [<div class="rb-c-review-comment-thumbnail__header">...</div>]
 *      <div class="rb-c-review-comment-thumbnail__content">...</div>
 *     </div>
