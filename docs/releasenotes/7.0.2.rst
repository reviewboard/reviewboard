Packaging
=========

* :pypi:`Django` 4.2.15 (or a higher 4.2.x) is now required.

  This is the latest security release for Django 4.2 LTS.


New Features
============

* Added a whole new way for administrators to view and work with another
  user's review requests.

  Administrators (and users with the special ``can_edit_reviewrequest``
  permission enabled) have the capability to access draft information for
  other users, in order to diagnose problems or reassign review requests.
  While the backend enabled this, the UI was never fully designed, and this
  led to bad experiences for administrators trying to review another user's
  code.

  We've fully reworked this experience. Administrators will now see review
  requests the same way everybody else does, but will have the option of
  viewing the other user's draft data if they have an unpublished review
  request, and can freely switch between the views.

  If an administrator is viewing the review request as a normal user, and
  that review request has an active draft, they'll be unable to edit the
  review request without switching to this special view. Review Board will
  detect when this is the case and help you switch.

Bug Fixes
=========

Administration UI
-----------------

* GitHub configuration help text has been made more readable.


Diff Viewer
-----------

* Fixed an issue where downloading a diff could result in files being in a
  different order from when it was uploaded. (:bug:`2812`)

  We applied some sorting of the files, for the purpose of helping with a
  better order in the diff viewer. This was done during diff upload, rather
  than when viewing a diff.

  The result could be a diff that had files in the wrong order, which was
  particularly a problem with Mercurial.

  We now preserve the order, and instead apply sorting only when viewing a
  diff.

* Files that were added in an uploaded commit range and modified in a later
  commit will now show up as a new file and not a modified file.


E-Mail
------

* Fixed automatically determining whether to send e-mails on people's
  behalf when DMARC records are formatted with a multi-string TXT record
  format.

  Usually, DMARC DNS records are in the form of::

      "v=DMARC1; p=reject; pct=100; ..."

  We now support parsing a multi-string variant in the form of::

      "v=DMARC1;" "p=reject;" "pct=100;" ...

* Fixed some HTML sneaking in to plain-text reply e-mails.


Repository Support
------------------

Mercurial
~~~~~~~~~

* Added looser validation of Mercurial commits during upload.

  We normally perform strict validation of the revisions used for commits
  during a diff upload, but Mercurial diffs don't have enough useful
  information to do this correctly.

  We've eased the requirements specifically for Mercurial, avoiding issues
  that could occur with multi-commit diff uploads.

  The trade-off is that certain invalid commits could pass validation, which
  may cause problems when trying to upload merge commits, malformed commit
  chains, or bad uploads from custom tools that talk to Review Board.

* Fixed parsing of Mercurial Git-style diffs that introduce new binary files.


Perforce
~~~~~~~~

* Worked around a regression in error handling introduced in
  :pypi:`p4python` 2024.1.2625398.

  This regression in Perforce's Python bindings could lead to a crash when
  trying to handle routine error responses.


Review Requests
---------------

* Fixed word-wrapping of text in Status Updates for build and code checker
  results.

* The Previous/Next File Attachment thumbnail buttons on the side of a file
  attachment review page will no longer link to a broken page if that file
  attachment can't be reviewed.

* Fixed a bug where the Review Request Updated notification bubble could
  appear when there's an unviewable draft diff.

  This only impacted administrators or special users who are able to access
  another user's drafts.

* Removed a harmless but visible JavaScript console error when the Review
  Banner fetches information on available drafts.


Review Board Platform
=====================

This section covers important changes that may benefit or impact developers
building extensions, clients, or integrations for Review Board.

* `Djblets 5.1.1 Release Notes
  <https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/releasenotes/djblets/5.1.1/>`_


Extensions
----------

* Custom review UIs can now access a region comment flag and resize handle
  elements (as JQuery-wrapped elements).

  These are available as:

  * :js:attr:`RB.RegionCommentBlockView.$flag`
  * :js:attr:`RB.RegionCommentBlockView.$resizeIcon`

* Most methods on :py:class:`reviewboard.scmtools.models.Repository` now
  require keyword arguments.

  Extensions using positional arguments will see deprecation warnings for
  now, and will be required to move over to keyword arguments by
  Review Board 9.

* :py:meth:`ReviewRequest.get_draft()
  <reviewboard.reviews.models.ReviewRequest.get_draft>` now checks that the
  provided user has access, rather than being the owner.

  This is an important change that may affect some extension authors. In
  order to enable the new administrator view behavior we discussed in
  `New Features`_ above, we needed to loosen requirements for this argument.
  If you are calling this method and expecting no draft to be returned for
  anyone but the owner, you may want to check your code and make sure it
  behaves as expected for administrator users.

* Added Python type hints throughout the following modules:

  * :py:mod:`reviewboard.diffviewer.parser`
  * :py:mod:`reviewboard.scmtools.managers`
  * :py:mod:`reviewboard.scmtools.models`
  * :py:mod:`reviewboard.reviews.models.review_request`
  * :py:mod:`reviewboard.reviews.templatetags.reviewtags`
  * :py:mod:`reviewboard.reviews.views.detail`
  * :py:mod:`reviewboard.reviews.views.mixins`
