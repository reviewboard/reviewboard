Reviewing Diffs
===============

Overview
========

Diffs can be reviewed in the Review Board diff viewer by clicking
:guilabel:`View Diff` on the review request action bar.

The diff viewer provides a side-by-side view of the old and new versions of
each modified file, complete with color coding and syntax highlighting. Lines
can be commented on directly, allowing the developer to see exactly what part
of code you're talking about in a review.

The top of the diff viewer shows the review request box, for reference.
Inside that box toward the bottom is an indicator showing the current
diff revision, sometimes followed by a listing of other revisions (if more
than one diff was uploaded to this review request), then a file listing, and
then the diffs.

Depending on the number of files modified, the diff viewer may be split across
multiple pages. You can jump to the pages using the paginator above or below
the diffs.


Commenting on Lines
===================

To comment on a line on a diff, simply click the line number, or click and
drag down to select multiple lines. A comment dialog will appear giving you
a text entry for writing your comment. When you're done, you can click
:guilabel:`Save` to save the comment.

After saving a comment, a green comment flag will appear next to the first
line in your selection, indicating that you have an unpublished comment. Click
the line number or comment flag to pop open the comment box for your existing
comment again.


Reading Existing Comments
=========================

The diff viewer will show blue comment flags along the left-hand side
next to the line numbers that were already reviewed. The number inside the
comment flag indicates how many comments were made on that line.

If you move the mouse cursor over the comment flag, a tooltip will appear
showing a summary of the comments made.

If you click on the comment flag or the line number, the comment dialog
will appear, along with a blue side panel on the left showing those existing
comments. You can still write new comments in the green area of the comment
box.

It's important to note that this is meant to be used as a reference to see if
other people have already said what you plan to say. The comment box is
**not** the place to reply to those comments. Instead, you can click the
:guilabel:`Reply` link next to the particular comment, which will take you
back to the review request page and open a reply box.


Viewing Other Diff Revisions
============================

Every public revision of a diff that was posted is available for review. You
can click the box for the diff revision next to the :guilabel:`Jump to
revision` label below the current diff revision indicator.

This is sometimes useful when you're in the middle of a review of a particular
diff, go away for a bit, and then come back to discover that a new diff
revision has been uploaded. In this case, a warning box will appear telling
you that you have additional comments on an older revision, with a helpful
link to jump back to that revision.


Viewing Interdiffs
==================

The diff viewer supports showing and commenting on :term:`interdiffs`. An
interdiff is the difference between two uploaded diff revisions. In other
words, it lets you see what changes the developer has made since the previous
version of the diff you looked at, which is really handy for large changes.

To view an interdiff between the current revision you're looking at and
another revision, click the box for the diff revision next to the
:guilabel:`Changes between r# and:` label.

.. note:: Due to the way that the diff viewer works, if a newer diff is based
          on a newer revision of a file, you may see other changes made to
          that file between those revisions that has nothing to do with the
          review itself.

          If you're a developer posting code and you want to sync your
          source tree, it's best to post your previous diff immediately
          after syncing and then post any new changes, in order to minimize
          this problem.
