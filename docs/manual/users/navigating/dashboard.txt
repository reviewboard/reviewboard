Overview
========

The dashboard is your primary method of accessing review requests. It
displays detailed information on review requests at a glance, and allows
filtering review requests.

After logging in to Review Board, you'll be taken to your dashboard. You can
always get back to it by clicking :guilabel:`Dashboard` on the navigation
banner near the top of the page.


Navigation Sidebar
==================

The dashboard provides a navigation sidebar with the following items:

* Starred Reviews
* Outgoing Reviews
* Incoming Reviews

  * To Me

It also lists each group you belong to, and each group you're watching.
Each item also lists the number of review requests in that view.
You can click on an item to be taken to that view of the dashboard.


Review Requests List
====================

The main area of the dashboard lists the review requests belonging to that
particular view. This is a detailed, sortable, customizable list.

Clicking on any review request in the list will take you to that particular
review request, while clicking on a submitter's name will take you to the
list of review requests submitted by that user.


Sorting
=======

The review request list can be sorted by clicking on a column header. Clicking
once will sort the column in ascending order, and clicking a second time will
sort that column in descending order. The column will have a little up or
down arrow indicating the sorting order. You can click the :guilabel:`X` next
to clear sorting for that column.

The dashboard provides two-level sorting. You can primarilty sort by one
column but in the case of multiple entries for a particular submitter,
timestamp, etc., you can have secondary sorting on another column. This is set
by simply clicking one column (which will be the secondary column) and then
clicking another column (which will be the primary).

The primary column is indicated by a black up/down arrow, and the secondary
column is indicated by a lighter grey up/down arrow.

Sorting options are saved across sessions.


Reordering Columns
==================

Columns in the dashboard can be reordered by clicking and dragging the column.
The columns will reorder as you're dragging to show you the new layout, and
when you release the mouse cursor the order will be saved.


Customizable Columns
====================

Different users have different things they want to see in the dashboard. You
can change which columns are shown and which aren't by clicking the
:guilabel:`...` button to the right of the columns. A pop-up menu will appear
showing which columns are shown and which aren't.

The following are available columns you can choose from:


My Comments
-----------

Shows a green comment flag if you have any unpublished comments on the review
request, or a blue comment flag if you have published comments. This allows
you to quickly see which review requests you've addressed.

Shows a message bubble icon for any review requests that have been updated or
have had discussion since you've last seen it. This does not apply to review
requests you haven't yet looked at.
