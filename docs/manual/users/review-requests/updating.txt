Updating Review Requests
========================

Updating review requests is very much like
:ref:`creating review requests <creating-review-requests>`. Once you have
a review request out there, you can upload a new diff, new screenshots,
or modify the fields. Any changes you make will be seen by you only until you
publish the changes.

To modify a field, either click on the field (in the case of
:guilabel:`Description` and :guilabel:`Testing Done`) or click on the pencil
icon. A text box will appear allowing you to modify the value.

As soon as you make any change, a draft banner will appear above the review
request asking you to optionally describe your changes. This is handy when
you've actually uploaded a new diff and want to say what changed in that
diff.

When you're finished, click :guilabel:`Publish Changes`. If you decided you
didn't want to make those changes, you can click :guilabel:`Discard Draft`
instead.

Depending on your particular setup, publishing a draft may send
an e-mail out to the reviewers, letting them know your change is ready to
reviewed again.
