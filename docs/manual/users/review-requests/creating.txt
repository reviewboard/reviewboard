Creating Review Requests
========================

A review request consists of, at a minimum, a diff, a summary, a
description, and some reviewers.

There are two main ways of submitting a new review request: through the
web UI and through :ref:`post-review`. We recommend the latter, as it does
a lot of work for you, and is actually required for some version control
systems, such as Perforce.


Web UI
======

To post a review request through the web UI, click
:guilabel:`New Review Request` in the upper-left of a page. This will take
you to a form where you can upload your diff. Before you can do this,
though, you'll need to create a diff.

The diff you provide needs to be in :term:`unified diff` format, and must
have revision information embedded in the file. CVS, Subversion, Git,
Mercurial and Bazaar provide this information. If you use Perforce,
though, you'll need to use :ref:`post-review` instead of the web UI. Note
that this means you can't just use a standard diff generated by the
:command:`diff` tool. You'll need to consult your version control system's
documentation for information on generating diffs.

Once you've generated the diff, specify it in the form. You'll also need to
specify the repository containing the code that the diff was generated
against. On many Review Board installations, you'll only have one choice, but
some may have multiple ones to choose from.

After selecting the repository, additional fields dependent on that repository
may become available. Here are some fields you may encounter.

Perforce repositories:

* :guilabel:`Change number`:

  The changeset number representing the change the diff is generated from.

Subversion repositories:

* :guilabel:`Base diff path`:

  The relative path of the directory you were in
  when you generated the diff, based on the repository. For example, if you
  locally have a checkout of :file:`trunk/reviewboard` named
  :file:`reviewboard`, and that was the directory you were in when you made
  the diff, then the base diff path would be ``/trunk/reviewboard``.

  This may also depend on how Review Board was configured. Consult your
  administrator if you have problems.

Once you've filled out all fields, click :guilabel:`Submit` to post the
review request.


Finishing the Review Request
============================

Once you've posted your initial diff through the web UI or :ref:`post-review`,
you'll have a draft of your review request posted. Nobody but you will be
able to see the review request until you publish it.

Before you publish the review request, you'll need to fill out the summary,
description and reviewers. Some of these fields may be filled in depending
on your repository type, the tool you used to post the review request, and
any defaults your administrator has set up for the reviewers (see
:ref:`managing-default-reviewers` if you're the administrator).

You can also add screenshots or preview your diff by clicking :guilabel:`View
Diff` in the review request action bar (in the top-right of the review
request), or replace it if the diff wasn't correct.

When you're finished, click :guilabel:`Publish Review Request` in the green
draft banner above the review request. You can also choose to discard the
review request by clicking :guilabel:`Discard`.

Depending on your particular setup, publishing a review request may send
an e-mail out to the reviewers, letting them know your change is ready to
review.
