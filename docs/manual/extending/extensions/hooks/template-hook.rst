TemplateHook
============

:py:class:`djblets.extensions.hooks.TemplateHook` is one of the most versatile
hooks, allowing you to inject your own HTML into templates at various points.

Template hooks have three parameters:

*
    **name**: The name of the template hook point to inject into.

*
    **template_name**: The filename of the template to render. This should
    refer to template files in your extensions ``templates`` directory.

*
    **apply_to**: An optional list of URL names to limit this hook to. This is
    useful when using a generic template hook point, but when you only want to
    inject onto a specific page. If this is not provided, the template will be
    rendered for all pages with the given hook point name.


Template Hook Names
===================

Additional template hook points are trivially added. If these are insufficient
for your needs, please send a message to our `mailing lists`_.

.. _mailing lists: https://www.reviewboard.org/mailing-lists/


All Pages
---------

``base-extrahead``
    Inside the ``<head>`` tag for the page. This is generally used for
    ``<meta>`` tags.

``base-css``
    Right after all Review Board CSS has loaded. This is generally used
    for ``<link>`` or ``<style>`` tags.

    If referencing extension-provided files, it's better to use
    :ref:`static bundles <extension-static-files>` instead.

``base-scripts``
    Toward the top of the page, after initial JavaScript files and before
    any page content. This is generally used for ``<script>`` tags. Note
    that scripts loaded here will delay rendering of the page.

    If referencing extension-provided files, it's better to use
    :ref:`static bundles <extension-static-files>` instead. For everything
    else, we recommend creating a :ref:`JavaScript extension
    <js-extensions>`.

``base-scripts-post``
    Toward the end of the page, after all Review Board JavaScript.
    This is generally used for ``<script>`` tags.

    If referencing extension-provided files, it's better to use
    :ref:`static bundles <extension-static-files>` instead. For everything
    else, we recommend creating a :ref:`JavaScript extension
    <js-extensions>`.

``base-before-nav``
    Toward the top of the page before the navigation bar
    (``#navbar-container``) and after the header bar (``#headerbar``).

``base-after-nav``
    Toward the top of the page after the navigation bar (``#navbar-container``).

``base-before-content``
    Right before the page content (at the beginning of ``#content``).

``base-after-content``
    Right after the page content (at the end of ``#content``).


Login Page
----------

``before-login-form``
    Right before the login form. Useful for displaying login instructions.

``after-login-form``
    Right after the login form. Useful for providing contact information
    in case of login issues.


E-mails
-------

``review-email-html-summary``
    Displayed right before the header text for reviews in HTML e-mails,
    and below any "Ship It!" text.

``review-email-text-summary``
    Displayed right before the header text for reviews in plain text e-mails,
    and below any "Ship It!" text.

Registration Page
-----------------

``before-register-form``
    Displayed right before the new account registration form. Useful for
    displaying login instructions.


``after-register-form``
    Displayed right after the new account registration form. Useful for
    providing contact information in case of login issues.


Review Request Pages
--------------------

``before-review-request-summary``
    The very top of the review request box, right before the summary
    information (containing the Summary field, review request ID, and
    created/updated/closed information). Content here will not be aligned with
    the summary information.

``after-review-request-summary``
    The area right below the review request box's summary information. Content
    here will not be aligned with the summary information.

``review-request-summary-pre``
    The area at the top of the element for the review request box's summary
    information. Content here will be properly padding and aligned with the
    summary information.

``review-request-summary-post``
    The area at the bottom of the element for the review request box's summary
    information. Content here will be properly padding and aligned with the
    summary information.

``before-review-request-fields``
    Right after the summary (and the field validation warning, if shown),
    and right before the fields in the review request box.

``after-review-request-fields``
    Right after the fields in the review request box, and before the extra
    panes shown (file attachments, issue summary table, etc.).

``before-review-request-extra-panes``
    Right after the fields in the review request box, and before the extra
    panes shown (file attachments, issue summary table, etc.).

    This is basically equivalent to ``after-review-request-fields``, but is
    preferable if you're explicitly trying to target the area right before
    the panes. This may impact placement or rendering in the future.

``after-review-request-extra-panes``
   Right after any extra panes shown in the review request box, as the last
   content at the bottom of the box.

``review-request-extra-panes-pre``
   The very top of the element containing extra panes in the review request
   box.

``review-request-extra-panes-post``
   The very bottom of the element containing extra panes in the review request
   box.

``change-summary-header-pre``
    Right before the box's header text for "Review Request Changed" entries.

``change-summary-header-post``
    Right after the box's header text for "Review Request Changed" entries,
    before the change description or fields.

``review-summary-header-pre``
    Right before the box's header text for reviews.

``review-summary-header-post``
    Right after the box's header text for reviews, before any comments.


Administration UI
-----------------

``admin-sidebar-administration``
    At the bottom of the built-in items in the "Administration" section of the
    sidebar.

``admin-sidebar-settings``
    At the bottom of the built-in items in the "Settings" section of the
    sidebar.

``admin-sidebar-manage``
    At the bottom of the built-in items in the "Manage" section of the
    sidebar.


..
    TODO: Include ones for the initial status updates entry. We might want
          to normalize the ID a bit first, since it uses underscores. For now,
          it's undocumented.


Example
=======

.. code-block:: python

    from reviewboard.extensions.base import Extension
    from reviewboard.extensions.hooks import TemplateHook


    class SampleExtension(Extension):
        def initialize(self) -> None:

                         template_name='myextension/after-nav.html',
                         apply_to=['view-diff', 'view-diff-revision'])

            TemplateHook(self,
                         name='before-register-form',
