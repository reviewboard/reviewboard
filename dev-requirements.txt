# As of p4python 2021.1.2128019, there are only compiled wheel packages for
# Python 2.7 and 3.6 through 3.9. p4python's setup.py doesn't support
# automatically locating p4api or OpenSSL on anything but Linux. We have to
# wire off Python 3.10 support for now when not running on Linux or arm64.
#
# On Apple M1, we use our own builds, since as of right now, there are no
# official arm64 p4python builds from Perforce.

# As of subvertpy 0.10.1, Python 3.8 support is busted, resulting in a
# SystemError during usage (though installation works fine). 0.10.1 was
# released on July 19, 2017, and there has not been an official release
# since (even though the upstream source does fix this). For now, we can't
# safely install this on Python 3.8.
