This module contains "collector" objects. Collectors provide a way to gather
"raw" results from a :class:`whoosh.matching.Matcher` object, implement
sorting, filtering, collation, etc., and produce a
:class:`whoosh.searching.Results` object.

The basic collectors are:

TopCollector
    Returns the top N matching results sorted by score, using block-quality
    optimizations to skip blocks of documents that can't contribute to the top
    N. The :meth:`whoosh.searching.Searcher.search` method uses this type of
    collector by default or when you specify a ``limit``.

UnlimitedCollector
    Returns all matching results sorted by score. The
    :meth:`whoosh.searching.Searcher.search` method uses this type of collector
    when you specify ``limit=None`` or you specify a limit equal to or greater
    than the number of documents in the searcher.

SortingCollector
    Returns all matching results sorted by a :class:`whoosh.sorting.Facet`
    object. The :meth:`whoosh.searching.Searcher.search` method uses this type
    of collector when you use the ``sortedby`` parameter.

Here's an example of a simple collector that instead of remembering the matched
documents just counts up the number of matches::

    class CountingCollector(Collector):
        def prepare(self, top_searcher, q, context):
            # Always call super method in prepare
            Collector.prepare(self, top_searcher, q, context)

            self.count = 0

        def collect(self, sub_docnum):
            self.count += 1

    c = CountingCollector()
    mysearcher.search_with_collector(myquery, c)
    print(c.count)

There are also several wrapping collectors that extend or modify the
functionality of other collectors. The meth:`whoosh.searching.Searcher.search`
method uses many of these when you specify various parameters.

NOTE: collectors are not designed to be reentrant or thread-safe. It is
generally a good idea to create a new collector for each search.
