This module provides basic functions for handling mime-types. It can handle
matching mime-types against a list of media-ranges. See section 14.1 of 
the HTTP specification [RFC 2616] for a complete explanation.

Contents:
    - parse_mime_type():   Parses a mime-type into its component parts.
    - parse_media_range(): Media-ranges are mime-types with wild-cards and a 'q' quality parameter.
    - quality():           Determines the quality ('q') of a mime-type when compared against a list of media-ranges.
    - quality_parsed():    Just like quality() except the second parameter must be pre-parsed.
    - best_match():        Choose the mime-type with the highest quality ('q') from a list of candidates.
