            scoring for a faster search. Default is 10.
        :param scored: whether to score the results. Overriden by ``sortedby``.
            If both ``scored=False`` and ``sortedby=None``, the results will be
            in arbitrary order, but will usually be computed faster than
            scored or sorted results.
        :param sortedby: see :doc:`/facets`.
        :param reverse: Reverses the direction of the sort. Default is False.
        :param groupedby: see :doc:`/facets`.
        :param optimize: use optimizations to get faster results when possible.
            Default is True.
        :param filter: a query, Results object, or set of docnums. The results
            will only contain documents that are also in the filter object.
        :param mask: a query, Results object, or set of docnums. The results
            will not contain any documents that are in the mask object.
        :param terms: if True, record which terms were found in each matching
            document. See :doc:`/searching` for more information. Default is
            False.
        :param maptype: by default, the results of faceting with ``groupedby``

    interface of the :class:`~whoosh.searching.Results` object, namely getting
    stored fields with __getitem__ (square brackets), iterating, and the
    ``score()`` and ``docnum()`` methods.

    The ``offset`` attribute contains the results number this page starts at
    (numbered from 0). For example, if the page length is 10, the ``offset``
    attribute on the second page will be ``10``.

    The ``pagecount`` attribute contains the number of pages available.

    The ``pagenum`` attribute contains the page number. This may be less than
    the page you requested if the results had too few pages. For example, if
    you do::

        ResultsPage(results, 5)

    but the results object only contains 3 pages worth of hits, ``pagenum``
    will be 3.

    The ``pagelen`` attribute contains the number of results on this page
    (which may be less than the page length you requested if this is the last
    page of the results).

    The ``total`` attribute contains the total number of hits in the results.

    >>> mysearcher = myindex.searcher()
    >>> pagenum = 2
    >>> page = mysearcher.find_page(pagenum, myquery)

    ...   print("%s. %r" % (page.offset + i + 1, fields))
